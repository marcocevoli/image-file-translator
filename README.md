# Qabiria's Image File Translator
This is a command line utility that copies and renames image files after translating them (for SEO purposes).

You'll need Python 3 on your computer.
1. Run the program.
2. Select the source language (the language in which your image files are named).
3. Select the target language (the language in which you want your file names).
4. Select the root folder where your image files are stored.
5. The program will duplicate all image files renaming these copies with automatically translated names.

It's just a proof of concept. Feel free to take what you need, as long as you respect the license.
